Sure, I can guide you through the process of creating a branch, performing a cross-branch pull, merging branches, and managing excess branches in Git using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

### 1. **Creating a Branch in VS Code**

1. Open VS Code and open your project folder.
2. Open the Source Control panel by clicking the Git icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+G`.
3. Click on the branch name at the bottom of the status bar to open the branch menu.
4. Click on "Create new branch..." and enter the name of the new branch.
5. Press `Enter` to create and switch to the new branch.

### 2. **Cross Pull Between Branches**

Cross-pulling means pulling changes from one branch to another branch.

1. Ensure you're on the branch that needs to be updated (e.g., `feature-branch`).
2. Open the Source Control panel.
3. Click on the ellipsis (`...`) in the top-right corner and select "Pull from..." to pull changes from another branch.
4. Select the branch you want to pull changes from (e.g., `main`).

### 3. **Merging Branches**

1. Ensure you are on the branch that you want to merge changes into (e.g., `main`).
2. Open the Source Control panel.
3. Click on the ellipsis (`...`) in the top-right corner and select "Merge branch..."
4. Select the branch you want to merge from (e.g., `feature-branch`).

### 4. **Managing Excess Branches**

To delete a branch you no longer need:

1. Open the Source Control panel.
2. Click on the branch name at the bottom of the status bar to open the branch menu.
3. Click on "Manage Branches..." to see a list of branches.
4. Right-click the branch you want to delete and select "Delete Branch".

Alternatively, you can use the integrated terminal in VS Code for more advanced Git operations:

- Open the terminal by pressing ``Ctrl+` ``.
- Use Git commands directly:

  ```sh
  # Create a new branch
  git checkout -b new-branch-name

  # Pull changes from another branch
  git pull origin other-branch-name

  # Merge another branch into the current branch
  git merge other-branch-name

  # Delete a branch
  git branch -d branch-to-delete
  ```

This workflow should help you manage branches effectively in Git using VS Code. If you have any specific scenarios or run into issues, feel free to ask!
